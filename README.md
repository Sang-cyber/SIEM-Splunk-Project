### **1. Install Splunk**

#### **Download and Install Splunk:**
- Go to the [Splunk website](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html) and download the **Splunk Enterprise Free** version (500MB/day limit).
- Install Splunk on your preferred operating system (Linux, Windows, macOS).

#### **Installation Steps:**

- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  wget -O splunk-<version>-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/<version>/linux/splunk-<version>-linux-2.6-amd64.deb"
  sudo dpkg -i splunk-<version>-linux-2.6-amd64.deb
  sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
  ```

- **Windows**:
  - Download the installer, follow the installation wizard, and start the Splunk service.

- Access Splunk Web UI via `http://localhost:8000` and log in with the default credentials.

### **2. Set Up Log Sources**

To use Splunk as a SIEM, you'll need to configure it to collect logs from various sources such as servers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and more.

#### **Syslog Integration (Linux-based systems)**
You can configure your network devices, firewalls, and Linux systems to forward logs to Splunk using **syslog**. This allows centralized log collection.

- **Configure Splunk to listen for syslog messages:**
  - Go to Splunk Web → Settings → Data Inputs → Add New → **UDP** → Select port 514 (common syslog port).
  - Set the sourcetype to `syslog`.

- **Configure your devices (e.g., Linux/Ubuntu) to forward logs to Splunk:**
  Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and add the following line:
  ```bash
  *.* @<Splunk_server_IP>:514
  ```
  Restart `rsyslog`:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
  ```

#### **Windows Event Logs**
For Windows machines, you can forward Windows Event Logs to Splunk:
- Install **Universal Forwarder** on your Windows machine (download it from the Splunk website).
- Configure it to forward logs to your Splunk server:
  ```bash
  ./splunk add forward-server <Splunk_server_IP>:9997
  ./splunk add monitor C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\System.evtx
  ./splunk restart
  ```

#### **Firewall Logs (e.g., Cisco ASA, Palo Alto)**
- Set your firewalls to send syslog data to Splunk.
- Ensure you configure specific ports and sourcetypes like `cisco:asa` or `pan:firewall`.

#### **Application Logs**
You can configure applications (e.g., web servers, databases) to forward their logs to Splunk by setting up log forwarding or using **Splunk Universal Forwarder**.

---

### **3. Index and Parse Logs**

#### **Index Creation**
Splunk stores incoming data in **indexes**, and organizing data in different indexes allows for better performance and manageability.

- Go to **Settings** → **Indexes** → **New Index**.
  - Name your index (e.g., `firewall_logs`, `windows_logs`).
  - Set the retention policy for how long you want to retain data.
  
#### **Parse Data**
Ensure your log data is being parsed properly into readable fields. Splunk automatically parses common log formats, but you can manually specify the source type and field extraction if needed:
- Go to **Settings** → **Source Types** and ensure each data input has the right source type (e.g., `syslog`, `cisco:asa`, `Windows:Security`).

---

### **4. Create Alerts and Reports**

Now that you have data flowing into Splunk, the next step is to create **alerts** for suspicious activities and generate regular reports.

#### **Create an Alert:**
1. Go to **Search & Reporting**.
2. Run a search query that reflects the conditions you want to monitor. For example:
   ```spl
   index=firewall_logs "denied" | stats count by src_ip
   ```
3. Click **Save As** → **Alert**.
4. Set the trigger condition, such as "When number of results is greater than 100" or "When event occurs".
5. Configure notifications (email, Slack, webhook, etc.).

#### **Common Alerts to Create:**
- **Multiple Failed Logins**: Monitor repeated failed login attempts.
  ```spl
  index=windows_logs EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip
  ```
- **Excessive Denied Connections**: Track blocked connections on firewalls.
  ```spl
  index=firewall_logs "denied" | stats count by src_ip
  ```

#### **Scheduled Reports**:
Create regular reports that are automatically emailed or available via the Splunk dashboard.
- Go to **Search & Reporting** → Create the desired search query.
- Click **Save As** → **Report** and schedule it to run daily, weekly, or monthly.

### **5. Build Security Dashboards**

Dashboards provide visual representations of your data for easier analysis. You can create customized dashboards that include charts, tables, and graphs for different security metrics.

#### **Steps to Create a Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Search & Reporting** → Run a search query.
2. Click **Save As** → **Dashboard Panel**.
3. Name the panel and choose an existing dashboard or create a new one.
4. Customize the layout and add multiple panels (e.g., firewall logs, login attempts, etc.).

#### **Example Dashboard Panels**:
- **Top 10 Source IPs by Connection Attempts**:
  ```spl
  index=firewall_logs | stats count by src_ip | sort - count | head 10
  ```
- **Failed Logins Over Time**:
  ```spl
  index=windows_logs EventCode=4625 | timechart count by src_ip
  ```

### **6. Splunk Apps and Add-ons**

Splunkbase offers a variety of apps and add-ons to extend Splunk’s functionality, including prebuilt dashboards and integrations with security tools.

#### **Steps to Install Splunk Apps:**
1. Go to **Splunkbase**: [https://splunkbase.splunk.com](https://splunkbase.splunk.com).
2. Search for security-related apps (e.g., **Splunk for Palo Alto Networks**, **Splunk for Cisco Security Suite**).
3. Install the app via **Splunk Web UI** → **Apps** → **Install app from file**.
4. Follow the app-specific instructions for configuration.

---

### **7. Implement Threat Intelligence**

You can enhance your SIEM solution by integrating threat intelligence feeds. Splunk can correlate logs with known malicious IPs, domains, or file hashes.

#### **Steps to Integrate Threat Intelligence:**
1. Install a threat intelligence app like **Splunk Security Essentials** from Splunkbase.
2. Add threat feeds (e.g., STIX/TAXII, free threat feeds from organizations like AlienVault).
3. Set up correlation rules that check your log data against threat intelligence indicators.

---

### **8. Monitor and Tune Your SIEM**

Once the SIEM is operational, continuously monitor it for false positives and adjust thresholds to minimize noise. Regularly review dashboards, tune alert rules, and improve data parsing.

#### **Monitoring Performance**:
- Check index health and data ingestion rates via **Settings** → **Monitoring Console**.
- Ensure that alerts are being triggered only for genuine threats by tuning search queries and thresholds.

---

### **Conclusion**

This project will help you build a comprehensive SIEM solution using Splunk, from log collection and analysis to creating alerts and visual dashboards. Once you are familiar with the basics, you can further expand this project by integrating advanced features like machine learning, anomaly detection, and custom threat detection logic.
